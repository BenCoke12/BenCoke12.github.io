  <h1>CONTENT!</h1>
  <p>Hello! Thank you for coming to my about page. <b>This text is bold.</b><em>This text is emphasized(displayed in italics).</em> After you have read the about
    page please don't forget to wipe your shoes on the way out. Have a great day!</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph. My name is Ben. I am a student at Heriot Watt University. When you are not standing you are either sitting or lying down. 
    If none of these variables return true then an exception has occured. In the case of an exception please re-orient yourself and reload the page.</p>
  <h2>Content but smaller.</h2>
  <p>Now that you are comfortable please settle down and enjoy the many excellent blog posts that are available on this website.
    My favourite is the Site Launched entry. It's a thriller!</p>
