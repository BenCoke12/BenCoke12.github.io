  <p>Hello! Thank you for coming to my about page. <b>This text is bold.</b><em>This text is emphasized(displayed in italics).</em> After you have read the about
    page please don't forget to wipe your shoes on the way out. Have a great day!</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph. My name is Ben. I am a student at Heriot Watt University. When I am not standing I am either sitting or lying down. If none of these variables
    return true then an exception has occured.
